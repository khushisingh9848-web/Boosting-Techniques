        "\n",
        "Ans: Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning that combines multiple weak learners to form a strong and accurate model. A weak learner is a model that performs only slightly better than random guessing (for example, a shallow decision tree).\n",
        "\n",
        "How Boosting Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting trains models sequentially, not independently. Each new model focuses more on the mistakes made by the previous models.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Boosting Improves Weak Learners:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sequential Learning:\n",
        "Models are trained one after another. Each new learner learns from the errors of the earlier learners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Increased Focus on Hard Examples:\n",
        "Misclassified data points are given higher importance (weights) so future models pay more attention to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Weighted Combination of Models:\n",
        "Final predictions are made by combining all weak learners, often giving more weight to better-performing models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduction of Bias and Error:\n",
        "By correcting previous mistakes step by step, boosting reduces bias and improves overall accuracy."

        "Ans: Difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting (Training Process)\n",
        "\n",
        "AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting are both boosting techniques, but they differ in how models are trained and how errors are handled.\n",
        "\n",
        "AdaBoost trains models sequentially by adjusting the weights of training samples. After each weak learner is trained, more weight is given to the misclassified data points, so the next model focuses more on those difficult cases. Models that perform well are given higher importance in the final prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Boosting, on the other hand, trains models sequentially by optimizing a loss function. Instead of reweighting data points, each new model is trained to predict the residual errors (gradients) of the previous model. This means every new learner corrects the mistakes by minimizing the overall loss using gradient descent."
